  Access AlphaPortal (AlphaRoute) school-bus data — students, stops, live bus
  GPS location, arrival notifications — from a shell with curl instead of
  running the alphaportal-mcp server. Capture the signed-in web app's refresh
  token ONCE (a paste-in-console one-liner, or the fpx browser bridge), then mint
  access tokens and curl the REST API directly. Use when you want AlphaPortal
  data without the MCP, in a script, or on a machine where the MCP isn't
  installed.

# AlphaPortal via curl (no MCP, no runtime bridge)

AlphaPortal's app (e.g. `cmsnc.alphaportal.app` — the `cmsnc` subdomain is the
school district) has **no bot wall** on its API (`api.alpharoute.app`): once you
hold a token, plain `curl` does every call — no browser extension at runtime.
Login itself is reCAPTCHA-gated and can't be scripted, so the credential is the
**refresh token** the web app stores in your signed-in browser. It's an 8-day,
reusable JWT; from it you mint a 30-minute access token with one unauthenticated
POST (no reCAPTCHA, no MFA).

So the flow is: **capture the refresh token once → mint an access token → curl.**

## 1. Capture the refresh token (once; repeat when it expires after ~8 days)

**Option A — paste-in-console (no fpx needed).** In a signed-in AlphaPortal tab,
open DevTools → Console and run:

```js
JSON.parse(localStorage.user).User.RefreshToken
```

Copy the value into your shell:

```sh
export ALPHAPORTAL_RT='<paste the refresh token>'
```

**Option B — fpx browser bridge** (needs the Transporter extension + a signed-in
`*.alphaportal.app` tab):

```sh
npm install -g @fetchproxy/cli                              # provides `fpx`
fpx profile add alphaportal --domain alphaportal.app
fpx profile declare alphaportal --local-storage user       # declare scope BEFORE first pairing
fpx local-storage user -p alphaportal                      # first call prints a pair code → approve in Transporter
export ALPHAPORTAL_RT=$(fpx local-storage user -p alphaportal | jq -r '.user | fromjson | .User.RefreshToken')
```

## 2. Mint an access token (each session, or when the last one is >30 min old)

```sh
export ALPHAPORTAL_TOKEN=$(
  curl -s -X POST https://api.alpharoute.app/AlphaCore/v1/public/refresh-token \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"refreshToken\":\"$ALPHAPORTAL_RT\"}" | jq -r '.data.token'
)
```

If `ALPHAPORTAL_TOKEN` is `null`, the refresh token is expired/invalid —
re-capture it (step 1).

## 3. Core call pattern

Every read is a GET with the bearer token; the envelope is `{success,data,message}`,
so pipe `.data` to `jq`.

```sh
alpha() { curl -s "https://api.alpharoute.app/$1" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALPHAPORTAL_TOKEN"; }

# your students (grab each studentId here first)
alpha AlphaPortal/v1/user-students/list | jq '.data.students[] | {studentId, name, gradeName}'

# live bus GPS for a student's PM run (shift 0=AM, 1=PM)
alpha AlphaPortal/v1/user-students/vehicle-location/218652901/1 | jq '.data.location'

# arrival/departure notifications
alpha AlphaPortal/v1/notifications/list | jq '.data.notifications[] | {title, body, creationDate}'
```

See `references/endpoints.md` for the full endpoint list, path variables, and
ready-to-run `jq` recipes.

## Status codes

- `401` — the access token expired (re-run step 2) or the refresh token died
  (re-capture, step 1).
- `400` with `developerMessage` — a required param is missing (e.g. a path
  `studentId`, or `studentId`/`radius` on a write).
- `success:false` in a `200` body — the API rejected the request; read
  `.developerMessage` / `.message`.

## Writes

Write endpoints (`radius-edit`, `setnotification`) exist and change real
transportation records; the `alphaportal-mcp` server gates them behind a
`confirm` dry-run. This shell skill has **no dry-run** — curl just does it — so
treat every write as real and permanent. Request bodies are in
`references/endpoints.md`. The transportation-request submission flow is
deliberately undocumented here (its body was not fully verified).
